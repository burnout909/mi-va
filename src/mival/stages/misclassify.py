"""Misclassification stage (spec §4.6). Implemented by Plan 7.

This is the implementation of a **medical algorithmic audit** (Liu, Glocker,
McCradden, Ghassemi, Denniston, Oakden-Rayner, *Lancet Digital Health* 2022).
It is deliberately a separate stage from evaluation, because the two have
opposite epistemic status: evaluation *estimates* performance for questions
fixed in advance (confirmatory), while this stage *discovers* failure modes
nobody pre-specified (exploratory). Mixing them invites reading the performance
table first and then reporting whichever subgroup looks interesting, which is
exactly the contamination the separation prevents.

Spec §4.6 states what this stage is: **not a module that performs a particular
comparison, but a query engine over run_key space.** Everything follows from
that. A selector names run_key *patterns*, never a model, so the same code
selects disagreement between models, between training modes, between
perturbation levels, between label definitions and between sites. If an axis
name ever appears inside a selector, this design has failed.
