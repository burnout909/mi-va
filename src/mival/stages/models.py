"""Models stage (spec §4.4). Implemented by Plan 4.

Contract pinned by Plan 2. ``evaluate`` reads ``PREDICTION_COLUMNS`` and is
being written in parallel against it.

This is the one stage that imports a backend, and it must do so lazily —
through ``mival.adapters.get_adapter`` — because the environment holding torch
does not hold TensorFlow.

Nothing in this file names a model. Every model-specific fact — which adapter
to use, which weights, which layer is the feature layer, which training modes
are supported, what the published threshold is, what the model was pretrained
on — is read from the ModelCard. That is claim C1: registering a model is one
JSON file and no source change. A single ``if model_id == …`` here would
falsify it, so there is none.

Three properties are enforced structurally rather than by convention:

* **The test split is touched exactly once.** Test records are held behind
  :class:`_TestSet`, which hands them out once and raises on a second request.
  Spec §4.4 requires that a second contact path not exist, not merely that it
  not be taken.
* **Thresholds are refit on dev only.** Probabilities are wrapped in a
  :class:`~mival.threshold.SplitScores` carrying the split they came from, and
  the refit policies reject anything but ``dev``.
* **Hyperparameters are chosen inside dev.** Selection runs a k-fold loop over
  the folds frozen in ``cohort_split.parquet``; the dev probabilities that feed
  the threshold refit are out-of-fold, so no threshold is chosen on data the
  model was fitted on.
