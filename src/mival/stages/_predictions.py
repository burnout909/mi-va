"""Reading the models stage output — shared by evaluation and the audit.

Stages 5 and 6 both consume ``predictions/<run_key>.parquet`` and both need the
same three things from it: the axes recovered from the file name, a grouping by
run_key, and the operating threshold of an arm.

They must agree exactly. A case selected as "just below the operating
threshold" is meaningless if the audit's threshold is not the number evaluation
reported its sensitivity at, and two copies of a threshold policy drift. So the
code lives here once and both stages call it, rather than being duplicated with
a test asserting the two copies still match.
