"""Backend-independent parts of ``Adapter.fit`` (spec §4.4).

Three things live here rather than in a backend module.

**The hyperparameter contract.** ``fit(handle, data, mode, hparams)`` receives
whatever the study's ``hparam_grid`` produced. Parsing it in one place means
torch and Keras cannot drift into understanding different keys, and an
unrecognised key is an error rather than a silent no-op — a misspelled
``learning_rate`` that is ignored turns a grid search into several identical
candidates whose AUROC differences are noise.

**The linear head.** ``linear_probe`` trains one logistic layer on top of a
frozen representation. Nothing about that is backend-specific once
``Adapter.features`` has produced the representation, so it is implemented once
in NumPy: both adapters get the same optimiser, the same regularisation and the
same early-stopping rule, and the whole thing is testable in an environment
with no backend installed at all.

**The stopping rule.** ``models`` selects hyperparameters by dev AUROC
(``SELECTION_METRIC``). Stopping on a different quantity than the one that
picks the winner would optimise for something the study does not report, so
early stopping watches AUROC too, on the validation fold the stage reserved.
