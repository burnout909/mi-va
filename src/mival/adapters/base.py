"""Adapter interface (spec §4.4).

Backends are imported lazily inside adapter methods so that `mival` core
imports cleanly in both the torch and the keras27 environment.

``fit`` is concrete here rather than abstract. ``linear_probe`` trains one
logistic layer on a frozen representation, and once ``features`` has produced
that representation nothing about the fit is backend-specific — so it is
implemented once, in NumPy, and both backends inherit exactly the same
optimiser, regularisation and stopping rule. Only the modes that actually
propagate gradients into the backbone are delegated to the backend, through
``_finetune``.
