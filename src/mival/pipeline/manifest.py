"""Run manifest (spec §3.7).

The manifest is what makes a result auditable: it records what went in, what
came out, on which code and which machine. Spec §3.7 also states that the
Technical Report is a rendering of manifests plus the exclusion ledger plus the
stage 5/6 artifacts, so every field here is eventually a cell in a table
somebody reads.

Writing the manifest is also the completion marker (see ``RunLayout.is_complete``),
so it must be written last and written atomically.
