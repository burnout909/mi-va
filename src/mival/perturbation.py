"""Perturbation grid and on-the-fly application (spec §4.3).

This is a pure function library, not a stage. Perturbed tensors are never
written to disk: spec §4.3 puts the perturbation in the dataloader and pins
reproducibility to ``seed + perturbation_id`` instead. Stage 3 therefore only
publishes the grid; stage 4 calls :func:`apply` per batch.

**The rule that gives this module its purpose.** Every perturbation restores
the signal to input-contract form. 500 Hz is degraded to 125 Hz and then
resampled *back* to 500 Hz; a 2.5 s window is zero-padded back to 10 s; a
dropped lead is zeroed rather than removed. Without that restoration the
measured quantity would be a mixture of information loss and shape mismatch,
and only the first of those is the thing under study.

Restoration includes the contract's *normalization*, which is why
:func:`apply` takes ``scaling``. Applying a 2x gain error to an already
z-scored tensor and stopping there would report a robustness failure that
cannot happen in deployment: a real mis-calibrated ECG passes through the
model's own normalization, which removes the gain. Re-applying the contract
scaling makes ``amplitude_scale`` correctly a no-op for a ``global_zscore``
contract and correctly a real gain error for a ``scaling: none`` contract.

**Constants not fixed by the spec.** Spec §4.3 names the noise *types* but no
amplitudes and no filter bands. Those live in :class:`NoiseConfig`, are stated
as configuration rather than fact, and are documented at their definition.

    ``sig`` is a tensor already compiled to a model's input contract. The
    result has the same lead names, lead count, sample count, rate and unit —
    that invariant is the point of the axis (spec §4.3) and is asserted below.

    ``scaling`` is the contract's normalization method; it is re-applied after
    the perturbation so that the restored signal is in contract form all the
    way through, not merely the right shape. See the module docstring.

    Application order is fixed: lead dropout, duration, resample, gain, noise.
    Noise is added last because it is an amplifier-side artifact — adding it
    before the resample round-trip would let the anti-aliasing filter partly
    remove the very artifact being injected. Under the default OFAT policy at
    most one axis is off baseline, so the order only bites in cartesian mode.
